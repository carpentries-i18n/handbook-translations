"The first Carpentries workshops in Africa were run in 2013 but it only "
"really kicked off in 2015. An African Task Force was established in 2016, "
"consisting of international mentors from the USA, UK, and Australia, and "
"guided the first batch of trained African instructors through the checkout "
"process as most of them were very isolated and new to the world of the "
"Carpentries."

"Since then more than 100 African instructors have participated in online or "
"in-person instructor training events. The African Task Force was revived in "
"December 2017, then completely consisting of African instructors. The task "
"force played a role in mentoring instructors who had been trained but hadn’t"
" qualified as well as qualified instructors who needed support before "
"teaching a workshop. Small online sessions were hosted by task force members"
" to demonstrate how various lessons are taught and to help solidify skills "
"in the tools we teach. The second African Task Force finished its activities"
" in December 2018. Some of the South African-based activities were funded "
"through the Rural Campuses Connection Project II (RCCP II), which ended in "
"March 2019. You can read more about the experiences of the African Task "
"Force in this blog post and about RCCPII here."
