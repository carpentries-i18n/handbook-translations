"The most likely reason posts fail to build is because of 'rogue' "
"characters in the YAML header. Rogue characters generally occur because "
"material has been pasted in directly from programs like Word or Google "
"documents. The most common rogue characters that cause issues are smart "
"quotes (curly quote marks as opposed to plain ones), but others might be "
"em or en dashes, mathematical or other symbols, or other characters that "
"cannot be rendered in plain text by typing on a keyboard. Replace smart "
"quotes with plain quote marks and smart em or en dashes with plain "
"hyphens to avert any problems."
