"While etherpads are generally reliable, you may find an etherpad not loading"
" as expected.  In this case, you can try appending /export/html to an "
"etherpad's url.  For example, if https://pad.carpentries.org/committeename "
"is not loading, it may be possible to recover its text by going to "
"https://pad.carpentries.org/committeename/export/html. This text content can"
" then be copied and pasted to a new etherpad. Note this will not preserve "
"the etherpad's history.  The chat will often still be active in the broken "
"etherpad, so it is recommended that you link to the new etherpad in the "
"broken etherpad's chat."
