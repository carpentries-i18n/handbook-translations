msgid "Software Carpentry (SWC), Data Carpentry (DC), and Library Carpentry (LC) are programs of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives). All programs offer two day long workshops taught live in-person by a team of two trained instructors. Software Carpentry focuses on best practices in computational programming that help scientists and researchers be more effective with their work. Lessons are domain agnostic and use generic data. All Software Carpentry workshops always cover three core areas: shell scripting (bash), version control (Git), and a programming language (R or Python). Read more here (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). Data Carpentry has a similar foundation but focuses on the data lifecycle, from cleaning & organization to analysis & visualization. Lessons and the data they use are domain specific, with offerings in ecology/biology, genomics, geospatial data, and more in the works. Read more here (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ ). Library Carpentry workshops teach people working in library- and information-related roles how to apply concepts from software development fields in library tasks and identify and use best practices in data structures."
