The primary goal of our assessment efforts is to evaluate the impact we are having teaching data skills throughout our global community. Our assessment efforts are meant to guide the development, implementation, and instruction of our workshops. We are committed to providing directed feedback to our community regarding our assessment targets and using information collected from assessment to improve how we teach data skills and build learning communities."
